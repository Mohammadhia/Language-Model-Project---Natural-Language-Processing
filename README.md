# Language-Model-Project---Natural-Language-Processing
A project that develops language models (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) from English, French, Spanish, and Italian corpora of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Langauge models are then used to predict what language a given text belongs to.
